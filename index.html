<!--About me text-->

	<p>Originally from Wild and Wonderful West Virginia, I have made Charlotte, North Carolina my home since 2001.  As a double English and theatre major at Queens University I studied great works of literature and ran around backstage designing sound and lights for various productions.  Once out in the "real world" I continued to hang out in libraries like it was my job (because it was) and continued to create fake worlds in the theatre. </p>     

	<p>Currently I am devoting my brain to developing my next super power:  coding.  I am committed to life-long learning and enjoy problem solving. Coding provides plenty of exercise in both of those departments.  I look forward to working with a team on the next challenge.</p>
